# Hasty.ai inference engine example

This repository is a naive implementation of web app that allows the user to upload an image and get some inferences from the models that are active on https://app.hasty.ai/ in a project they have access to.

Hasty is an image annotation tool that makes it easier, faster and more accurate to teach machines the context of what they are looking at. Learn more more at:
